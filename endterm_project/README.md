#Welcome! Here is a little information about my delivery company.

In this project, I have information about couriers, customers, products and much more.

Everything worked through the product order, the courier delivered the product to the customer using a special transport. There are two types of couriers: those who deliver the order from door to door, and those who deliver only to the post office.
There is online tracking, where the customer can see where his order is in online mode.
