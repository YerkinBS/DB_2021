▪ Initial phase - characterize fully the data needs of the prospective database users.

▪ Second phase - choosing a data model
   • Applying the concepts of the chosen data model
   • Translating these requirements into a conceptual schema of the database.
   • A fully developed conceptual schema indicates the functional requirements of the enterprise.
       ▪ Describe the kinds of operations (or transactions) that will be performed on the data.

▪ Final Phase - Moving from an abstract data model to the implementation of the database
• Logical Design - Deciding on the database schema.
   ▪Database design requires that we find a “good” collection of relation schemas.
